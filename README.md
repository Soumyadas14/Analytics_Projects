# Student Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the data analysis of student performance data, with the goal of understanding how various factors such as parents' education, studying hours, and more impact students' writing and reading scores. The main objectives are to gain insights into the key factors influencing student performance and provide valuable insights for educators and parents.

## Data Source
The student dataset was collected and includes information on students' demographics, parents' education levels, study habits, and academic performance. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

## Key Findings
The EDA revealed several key insights, including:

- The impact of parents' education levels on student scores.
- The relationship between studying hours and academic performance.
- Gender-based differences in student performance.
- The distribution of writing and reading scores.

## How to Start
The project contains all the processes of loading datasets, data preprocessing, EDA, and visualization. You can follow the steps outlined below to explore the project:

### Steps
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries & Loading Datasets**: Start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the student dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing & Preparing Datasets**: Perform data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**: Analyze the data to gain insights into the factors influencing student performance. Visualizations are provided to aid in understanding the data.
